[Phone ringing . . .]
Bill: Hey, this is Bill. I’m sorry I’m not in. Just leave a message.

[Beep]

Hey Bill. This is Hank. I’m just calling to let you know that I’ll be a little late to the game tomorrow night.
I have to work a few extra hours to finish a report. I should wrap things up sometime between seven and eight though.
Oh, then I’m planning on dropping by Lisa’s house for about an hour since she’s been sick recently. And, uh, one more thing.
I’ll swing by my house to pick up some food for the game. See you then.
