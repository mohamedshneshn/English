Man: Honey, the basketball game’s about to start. And could you bring some chips and a bowl of ice cream? And . . . uh . . . a slice of pizza from the fridge.

Woman: Anything else?

Man: Nope, that’s all for now. Hey, hon, you know, they’re organizing a company basketball team, and I’m thinking about joining. What do you think?

Woman: Humph

Man: “Humph” What do you mean “Humph.” I was the star player in high school.

Woman: Yeah, twenty-five years ago. Look, I just don’t want you having a heart attack running up and down the court.

Man: So, what are you suggesting? Should I just abandon the idea? I’m not that out of shape.

Woman: Well . . . you ought to (oughta) at least have a physical before you begin. I mean, it HAS been at least five years since you played at all.

Man: Well, okay, but . . .

Woman: And you need to watch your diet and cut back on the fatty foods, like ice cream. And you should try eating more fresh fruits and vegetables.

Man: Yeah, you’re probably right.

Woman: And you should take up a little weight training to strengthen your muscles or perhaps try cycling to build up your cardiovascular system. Oh, and you need to go to bed early instead of watching TV half the night.

Man: Hey, you’re starting to sound like my personal fitness instructor!

Woman: Nah, I just love you, and I want you to be around for a long, long time.
