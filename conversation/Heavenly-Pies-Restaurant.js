Waiter: Hi. Welcome to Heavenly Pies. May I take your order?

Man: Uh . . . yes. I’d like the chicken fried steak.

Waiter: Okay. Would you like fries, bread, or rice with your meal?

Man: Hmm. I’ll take the rice?

Waiter: Would you care for anything to drink?

Man: Yeah. I’ll take a medium orange juice.

Waiter: I’m sorry. We only have large or small.

Man: Well, in that case, uh, I’ll have a small one.

Waiter: Okay. A small juice. And what kind of dressing would you like with your salad. It comes with the fried steak.

Man: What dressings do you have?

Waiter: We have French, Italian, blue cheese, and ranch.

Man: Oh! Ranch, please.

Waiter: Would you like anything else?

Man: Well, I’d like to see your pie menu. That’s the main reason why I like to dine here.

Waiter: Oh, I’m sorry, but we aren’t serving pies today.

Man: Huh? I thought this was Heavenly Pies Restaurant.

Waiter: Well, it usually is, but, Dave, our baker, slipped on a banana in the kitchen two days ago, and hurt his leg. [Oh] He’ll be out for at least two weeks. In the meantime, we’re serving ice cream sundaes instead. Sorry.

Man: Wow. I’m sorry to hear that. Um, well in that case, I’ll have an ice cream sundae.

Woman: Okay. I’ll be back with your order in a few minutes
