Man: Hey, stop. [What?] And give me your money.

Woman: What? No, no. Listen here.

Man: No, you listen. Hand over your purse, and I won’t hurt you.

Woman: Ha. You’ve got to be joking.

Man: Do I look like I’m joking?

Woman: Heh. Look. I only have two dollars in change.

Man: I don’t care. Give it to me! And your phone and credit cards.

Woman: Okay. Listen. Obviously, you haven’t thought this through. I mean, who’s gonna [going to] rob someone as they walk out of a karate studio? Really?

Man: Right. You don’t fool me. Anyone can get a black belt online in 10 minutes. And I have a knife.

Woman: Listen, mister. I’m telling you to back off. I’m a fifth-degree black belt, and I’ve trained for 25 years. I don’t want to hurt you, but I’ll defend myself if I have to.

Man: Alright, baby. Let me have it.

Woman: You’d better call 911 first.

Man: Right.

[Punches and kicks and yells and screams . . . ]

Man: Ahh, oh, man. Ooohhhh. That hurts.

Woman: Yeah. Listen. Here’s your two dollars. You’ll need them to cover your medical bills.
