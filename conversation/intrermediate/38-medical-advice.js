Receptionist: Okay. Um . . . how about Tuesday at 8:00 A.M. or Thursday at 8:15 A.M.?

Receptionist: Alright. And what’s the nature of your visit?

Ronald: Uh . . .

Receptionist: Yes sir.

Ronald: Well, to tell the truth, I fell from a ladder two days ago while painting my house,
 and I sprained my ankle when my foot landed in a paint can. I suffered a few scratches on my hands and knees,
 but I’m most concerned that the swelling in my ankle hasn’t gone down yet.

Receptionist: Well, did you put ice on it immediately after this happened?

Ronald: Well yeah. I just filled the paint can with ice and . . .

Receptionist: And so after you removed the paint can . . . Sir, sir, Mr. Schuller, are you still there?

Ronald: Well that’s part of the problem. Uh, the paint can is still on my foot.

Receptionist: Look, Mr. Schuller. Please come in today. I don’t think your case can wait.
