"Hello students! Today, we'll learn about prefixes and suffixes.

A prefix is a group of letters added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning.
For example, (un) is a prefix that means not.
So, when we add (un) to "happy," we get "unhappy," which means not happy or sad.


A suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a word to change its meaning.
For example, (s) is a suffix that means more than one.
When we add (s) to "book," we get "books," which means more than one book.

Remember,
 prefixes come before the base word, and suffixes come after the base word.
 They both play essential roles in expanding our vocabulary and understanding the meaning of words."

"Hello students! Today, we'll learn about nouns and verbs.

A noun is a person, place, or thing.
For example, "teacher" is a noun because it's a person.
"School" is a noun because it's a place.
And "book" is a noun because it's a thing.

A verb is an action word.
For example, "teach" is a verb because it's an action.
"Learn" is a verb because it's an action.
And "read" is a verb because it's an action.

Remember,
    nouns are people, places, or things.
    verbs are actions.

special tools made it easier for people to ride them like pedals and brakes.
bycicles riders could stop more easily.
bycicles were also closer to the ground.
