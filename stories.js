i'm particularly proud and happy about the young filmmakers, actors, singers, writers, producers that are coming up behind my generation.

in particular,barry jenkins.Young people understand this young man made 10,15,20 short films before he got the opportunity to make moonlight,

so never give up. Without commitment, you'll never start, but more importantly, without consistency, you'll never finish.

It's not easy.

If it was easy, there'd be no kerry washington. If it was easy, there'd be no taraji henson. P. Henson. 

So, keep working. Keep striving. Never give up. Fall down seven times, get up eight. Ease is a greater threat to progress than hardship.
So, keep moving, keep growing, keep learning. See you at work.
